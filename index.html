<h2>WEB</h2>

<p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the foundation for the Web- HTTP, HTML, a browser, a server, and the first website in order to manage documentation at CERN.[2][4]

While the Web was a success at CERN, it was not very popular elsewhere. In two years, there were only 50 websites.[5]

After the NCSA released Mosaic, a graphical browser that could display inline images[6] and submit forms,[7] and HTTPd, a server that could process forms (see CGI), the Web became very popular with thousands of websites springing up in less than a year.[8]

In 1994, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape and released Navigator which introduced Java and JavaScript to the Web. It quickly became the dominant browser. In 1995, Netscape had a very successful IPO which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.[9]

Microsoft responded by developing their own browser, Internet Explorer. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.[10]</p>
